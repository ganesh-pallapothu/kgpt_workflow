**What is kgpt workflow ?**
The KGPT workflow is designed to facilitate efficient and effective software development. Here's an overview of the workflow:

Code Request: A developer submits a code request to KGPT, providing details about the task, such as the programming language, functionality, and any specific requirements.
Code Generation: KGPT's AI engine generates the code based on the request, using its knowledge graph and machine learning algorithms to produce high-quality, readable, and well-documented code.
Code Review: The generated code is reviewed by the developer to ensure it meets the requirements and is free of errors.
Iteration and Refining: If necessary, the developer can provide feedback to KGPT, and the AI engine will refine the code to better meet the requirements.
Code Deployment: Once the code is approved, it can be deployed to the production environment.
Key Benefits:

Increased productivity: KGPT automates the coding process, freeing up developers to focus on higher-level tasks.
Improved code quality: KGPT's AI engine generates code that is consistent, readable, and well-documented.
Reduced errors: KGPT's code generation reduces the likelihood of human error, resulting in fewer bugs and defects.

    Use scheduling tools to trigger automation scripts at regular intervals
  Monitor and Maintain: Monitor the automation workflow and maintain it as needed. For example:
    Use logging and monitoring tools to track automation script execution
    Use version control systems to manage automation script changes
Example automation script:
  # This is AI generated code, please refer KPIT AI Policy before using this in your projects
import os
import requests

# Define KGPT API endpoint and credentials
kgpt_api_endpoint = "https://kgpt-api.example.com"
kgpt_api_token = "your_kgpt_api_token"

# Define automation task
def automate_code_generation():
    # Generate code using KGPT API
    response = requests.post(
        kgpt_api_endpoint + "/generate-code",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {kgpt_api_token}"},
        json={"language": "python", "functionality": "hello world"}
    )
    generated_code = response.json()["code"]
    
    # Save generated code to file
    with open("generated_code.py", "w") as f:
        f.write(generated_code)

# Define automation trigger
def automate_trigger():
    # Trigger automation script on code changes
    os.system("git pull")
    automate_code_generation()

# Run automation script
automate_trigger()


**Is it similar to aws step functions ?**

                      Install the unittest library using pip: **pip install unittest**
**Step 2:** Create a New Directory for the Project
                      Create a new directory for the project: **mkdir kgpt-workflow**
Navigate to the new directory: **cd kgpt-workflow**
**Step 3:** Create a New File for the .yml Configuration
                      Create a new file called kgpt-workflow.yml in the project directory: **touch kgpt-workflow.yml**
Open the file in a text editor and add the following contents:

stages:
  - generate-code
  - test
  - deploy

generate-code:
  stage: generate-code
  script:
    - python automate_code_generation.py
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - generated_code.py

  dependencies:
    - generate-code

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - python deploy_generated_code.py
  dependencies:
    - test


**Step 4:** Create a New File for the **automate_code_generation.py** Script
                  Create a new file called automate_code_generation.py in the project directory: **touch automate_code_generation.py**
Open the file in a text editor and add the following contents:
import requests

# Define the prompt for the KGPT API
prompt = "Generate a Python class for a calculator with methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division."

# Make a POST request to the KGPT API
response = requests.post("https://kgpt-api.example.com/generate-code", json={
    "prompt": prompt,
    "max_tokens": 1024,
    "temperature": 0.7
})

# Get the generated code from the response
generated_code = response.json()["code"]

# Save the generated code to a file
with open("generated_code.py", "w") as f:
    f.write(generated_code)



**step5:** Create a New File for the **test_generated_code.py** Script
Create a new file called test_generated_code.py in the project directory: **touch test_generated_code.py**
Open the file in a text editor and add the following contents:

import unittest
from generated_code import Calculator

class TestCalculator(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        calculator = Calculator()
        self.assertEqual(calculator.add(2, 3), 5)

    def test_subtract(self):
        calculator = Calculator()
        self.assertEqual(calculator.subtract(5, 3), 2)

    def test_multiply(self):
        calculator = Calculator()
        self.assertEqual(calculator.multiply(4, 5), 20)

    def test_divide(self):
        calculator = Calculator()
        self.assertEqual(calculator.divide(10, 2), 5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()


**Step 6:** Create a New File for the **deploy_generated_code.py** Script
                      Create a new file called deploy_generated_code.py in the project directory: **touch deploy_generated_code.py**
Open the file in a text editor and add the following contents:
import os

# Deploy the generated code to a production environment
os.system("git add generated_code.py")
os.system("git commit -m 'Deploy generated code'")
os.system("git push origin main")



**Step 7:** Run the KGPT Workflow
Run the KGPT workflow using the following command: **kgpt-workflow run kgpt-workflow.yml**
This will execute the workflow and generate the code for the calculator class. The generated code will be saved to a file called generated_code.py in the project directory.
